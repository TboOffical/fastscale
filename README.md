# What?

## Mission
Fastscale will be one backend for everything and anything! In a world that moves slowly, build quickly without worrying about scalability or future-proofing. 
### The Dream
1. Define Data
2. Run Command
3. Get Backend

## What's in backend
It depends, but for our backend(for anything), it should have a relatively broad set of abilities.
* User Management
* Data Management
* Rest API
* Realtime Services

# How? 
Slowly, at the moment, and always with **Go**.
